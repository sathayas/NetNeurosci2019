# NetNeurosci2019
***Repository for codes, figures, and notes for the Network Neurosci Satellite at NetSci2019***

***
Codes to generate some of the figures for my talk at the Network Neuroscience Satellite Meeting at NetSci2019. Also Jupyter notebook documents for demonstration.

*You are welcome to use codes in this repo for your use.* ***I will not provide any support for codes and Jupyter documents on this repository***. *Use at your own risk.*


## Requirements
To run codes in this repository, you need **Python 3.6** or later. In addition, a number of libraries are needed. You can install dependencies by
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
depending on your OS. Unfortunately this does not work on Anaconda users (*sorry!*). You have to manually install packages listed in **`requirements.txt`** file.

## Slides & demo note
You can find the PDF version of my presentation slides [here](https://github.com/sathayas/NetNeurosci2019/raw/master/Hayasaka_Talk_Slides.pdf). Sorry, no animations. You can download / view animations individually on this repo (either .mp4 or .gif format).

The demonstration note is a Jupyter notebook document (**`Demo.ipynb`**). You can open it with Jupyter to run code snippets. Or you can just read it via [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sathayas/NetNeurosci2019/blob/master/Demo.ipynb) on your web browser (no running of codes though).
